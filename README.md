# NovelAI-via-tkinter
 use the text generator in NovelAI on your desktop

## The point of this app
 To use NovelAI models from your desktop, with some cool extra features (currently only multi-generate)

## Current features
- multi generation

## 2 versions:
- app rewriting.py is the newest version, less tested and has experimental stuff
- app previous version.py is more stable but more boring

## partial to-do list (somewhat in order of importance)
- stuff to automatically edit the prompt before and/or after generating text (*cough* wannabe scripting *cough*)
- bare-bones lorebook
- make an executable so you don't have to install Python
- make code more readable
- explicit (via user interface) support for a 'storage' folder, and 'personal prompt.txt' and 'personal settings.txt' for custom default prompt and settings
