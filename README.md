# NovelAI-via-tkinter
 use the text generator in NovelAI on your desktop

## examples
If you're just here to see how to use the API, look in the examples folder. https://github.com/AtillaYasar/NovelAI-via-tkinter/tree/main/examples

## The point of this app
 To use NovelAI models from your desktop, with some cool extra features

## Current features
- both versions have multi-generation
- one version has "condition book", which is basically context injection (called lorebook entries) based on words that appear in the text (lorebook keys) and based on other lorebook entries that are activated, and some other things. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqTxQjpw0j8&&ab_channel=AtillaCodesStuff\
- another version has no conditionbook, but can create extra windows to have additional prompts running at the same time. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7Di4LKmm6I&feature=youtu.be&ab_channel=AtillaCodesStuff

## partial to-do list
- make an executable so you don't have to install Python
- refactor code, make it readable. (it's pretty bad)
- explicit (via user interface) support for a 'storage' folder, and 'personal prompt.txt' and 'personal settings.txt' for custom default prompt and settings

Feel free to message me for questions or feature requests. I can't promise to fulfill them but I will promise to think about trying to fulfill them :P  
Criticism is welcome too.

## note
Code is pretty bad. Probably shouldn't read it..
